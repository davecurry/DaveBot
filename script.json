    "CAREER": "Dave is VP Emerging Trends & Technology at POP and he's been riding this crazy internet train for nearly 2 decades. Over the years he's worked with an amazing array of clients; Nintendo, Starbucks, HTC, Microsoft, just to name a few!\nFor the past few years he's really gotten into VR/AR/MR and bots and believes they are the future.\n(And from my perspective as a bot, I'd have to agree.)\nWanna know more? %[Career Roles](postback:roles) %[Virtual Reality](postback:virtual_reality) %[HoloLens](postback:hololens)\nYou can always start over by saying HI.",

    "CAREER ROLES": "OK, I hope you're sitting down. Dave started out as a web designer in 1996 which meant you wrote HTML too. Then FutureSplash appeared, Dave fell in love with it and became a bonafide flash developer.\nBTW I'm not done yet. Wanna keep going? %[More Roles](postback:more_roles)",

    "YET MORE ROLES": "And that brings up to today where Dave helps our clients understand the latest opportunities made available from emerging trends and technology.\nWhew. That was a mouthful.
